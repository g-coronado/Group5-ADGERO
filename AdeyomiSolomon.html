      <h2>Introduction to Wellness</h2>
      <p>Wellness is the active process of making choices toward a healthy and fulfilling life. The Global Wellness Institute defines wellness as the active pursuit of activities, choices and lifestyles that lead to a state of holistic health. Wellness is an individual pursuit—we have self-responsibility for our own choices, behaviors and lifestyles but, it is also significantly influenced by the physical, social and cultural environments in which we live. It encompasses multiple dimensions and achieving balance in these areas is essential to overall well-being.</p>
      <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined health as, “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity." Although wellness can be defined similarly, some suggest that wellness is more active and process-oriented whereas health is more of a state of being.</p>

      <p>Wellness is different from healthcare. Our healthcare systems use a pathogenic and reactive approach, focused on causes, consequences, diagnosis and treatment of diseases and injuries. In contrast, wellness is a salutogenic and proactive approach, focused on prevention, healthy lifestyles and the pursuit of optimal wellbeing. Ultimately, a solid foundation for wellness helps us prevent and overcome disease, both at present and in the future.</p>

        <p>Emotions are central to what it means to be human. We feel deeply, and those emotions often lead us to do things. Emotions are also a key ingredient in well-being. It's hard to imagine well-being without happiness. And emotions like sadness and anxiety can make well-being more difficult to achieve. Some might even use the words happiness and well-being interchangeably</p>
        <p>Happiness includes both momentary positive emotions and a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in life. Sometimes these parts are split up in to hedonia (pleasure) and eudaimonia (more like thriving or flourishing), but most of the time when people say "happiness", they are talking about the combination of both. So what are the right steps to take for building happiness? Well, it depends on what personal challenges you face, what situations you’re in, and what’s happening in the world around you. That’s why we need to look inward, to gain clarity on our personal challenges, as well as outward, to gain clarity on the social or cultural challenges we are all dealing in the moderns world.
        <p>Wellness generally wraps around everything. Your emotions and happiness impacts your everyday life and determines the quality of your life. </p>

        <p>Sleep greatly impacts our overall wellness.the researchers found that the people who had the most extra sleep during the weekends were 19% less likely to develop heart disease than those with the least amount of weekend sleep. The lowered risk of heart disease was even more pronounced for people who regularly experience inadequate sleep on weekdays. </p>
